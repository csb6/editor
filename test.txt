Welcome to the editor!

Right now, it has no name, but maybe one day it will.

Right now, the editor supports a few different features,
such as:
- Line numbers
- Save, Save As, and Open operations for files
  using CMD-S, CMD-Shift-S, and CMD-O
- Emacs-like "Next word" and "Prior word" with
  CMD-F and CMD-B
- Basic support for font-loading; right now, the program
  is configured to use Monaco, a monospace font on macOS.
- Indication as to when the current buffer has been edited

Hopefully there will be more features to come!
